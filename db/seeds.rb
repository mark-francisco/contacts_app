# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# new_seed_contact = Contact.create({:first_name => "Robinson", :last_name => "Cano", :email => "RobbyC@example.com", :phone_number => "4444444444"})

# new_seed_contact = Contact.create({:first_name => "Leslie", :last_name => "Johansson", :email => "LJo@example.com", :phone_number => "7"})
